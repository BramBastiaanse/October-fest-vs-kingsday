## Motivation

We want to assess and investigate; how the Gran Prix locations during a Gran Prix weekend affects AirBnB market (demand,supply and price) in Spain and Shanghai. Our motivation is to offer a clear understanding and picture to the landlords and to the consumers about the prices and availability of the AirBnb houses. For landlords, we like to assess the prices during these events and state a profitable period to place an ad on AirBnb. For the consumers, we like to estimate the most affordable AirBnbs during the Formula 1 events. So, both landlords and consumers will have an vision about the pricing and the availability of the AirBnbs in Spain and Shanghai during race weekends.

## Method and results

In order to solve the our research question, we needed to compare the regression analyses of both cities during race weekends(Barcelona, Spain and Shanghai, China). Using a regression analysis, we can view whether the independent variable (race weekend) and controlvariables are significant on the rent of an AirBnB in one of the cities.
