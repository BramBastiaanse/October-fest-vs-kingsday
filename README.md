# Which national holiday pays-off the most?

Which national holiday (kingsday vs. Octoberfest), affect supply, demand and prices of the AirBnBs in Amsterdam and Munich most.

## Motivation

We want to assess and investigate; how national holidays such as Kingsday and Octoberfest affects AirBnB market (demand,supply and price) in Amsterdam and Munich. Our motivation is to offer a clear understanding and picture to the landlords and to the consumers about the prices and availability of the AirBnb houses. For landlords, we like to assess the prices on these national holidays and state a profitable period to place an ad on AirBnb. For the consumers, we like to estimate the most affordable AirBnbs during the national holidays. So, both landlords and consumers will have an vision about the pricing and the availability of the AirBnbs in Amsterdam and Munich during festive days.
