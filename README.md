# Which Air BnB sits on pole position? 

Which Gran Prix (Spanish Gran Prix, or Chinese Granprix) affect demand and prices most. 

## Motivation

We want to assess and investigate; how the Gran Prix locations during a Gran Prix weekend affects AirBnB market (demand,supply and price) in Spain and Shanghai. Our motivation is to offer a clear understanding and picture to the landlords and to the consumers about the prices and availability of the AirBnb houses. For landlords, we like to assess the prices during these events and state a profitable period to place an ad on AirBnb. For the consumers, we like to estimate the most affordable AirBnbs during the Formula 1 events. So, both landlords and consumers will have an vision about the pricing and the availability of the AirBnbs in Spain and Shanghai during race weekends.

## Method and results

First, introduce and motivate your chosen method, and explain how it contributes to solving the research question/business problem.
In order to see the magnitude the race weekends have on price, we choose to run a linear regression. This way we can take control variables into account and create a predicted price for an Air BnB location based on their specific characteristics. These characteristiccs include a.o.; size of the AirBnB, distance to the circuit, reviews, etc. 

Second, summarize your results concisely. Make use of subheaders where appropriate.

Repository will be enhanced once files are added to the document. 

## Running instructions
(Improve once we actually start on this thing)

Explain to potential users how to run/replicate your workflow. Touch upon, if necessary, the required input data, which (secret) credentials are required (and how to obtain them), which software tools are needed to run the workflow (including links to the installation instructions), and how to run the workflow. Make use of subheaders where appropriate.
